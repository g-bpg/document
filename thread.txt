> What is this?
/bpg/ is the Beginner Programmer's General, your one-stop shop for all things
pertaining to learning the ropes of the fascinating world of computer science.

This is a small experiment, with the idea of a "beginner's general" borrowed
from /ic/.

Something rather useful in /ic/'s /beg/ is a document with a collection of
resources and advice. I took the time to write such a document, linked below.

In broad terms, the beginner's document contains answers to common questions
such as "Which language should I start?", "How do I learn programming?", and
"What are tools I can use to program"?

> Why? 
I've noticed a lot of people on /dpt/ asking the same sort of questions, and it
commonly devolves into a shitshow. The hope is by splitting, we slow down /dpt/
and are able to have more substantial discussions in both threads.

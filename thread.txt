>What is this?
/bpg/ is the Beginner's Programmer General, your one-stop shop for all things pertaining to learning the ropes of the fascinating world of computer science. The idea of a "beginner's general" is borrowed from /ic/.

>"How do I learn programming?"
>"Which language should I start with?"
>"What are tools I can use to program?"
See the document at >>>> https://rentry.co/bpg <<<<

>Why?
A lot of people on /dpt/ ask the same sort of questions and it devolves into a shitshow. The hope is that by separating we can slow down /dpt/ and are able to have more substantial discussions in both threads.

>I want to talk off-thread
Scroll to the bottom of the rentry. IRC, Matrix and Discord are provided and are all bridged together.

Crack a beer and start coding, bros.

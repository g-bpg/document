# bpg-document

The Markdown document for /bpg/, the Beginners Programming General.
[See the document](https://git.lain.church/WeedSmokingJew/bpg-document/src/branch/master/document.md), might be slightly broken because it's not Rentry.

Speaking of which, the Rentry will be updated occasionally, from this repository.

## Contributing Guideline
